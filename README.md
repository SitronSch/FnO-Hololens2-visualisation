## Important

<b>Simple ITK</b> - Assets/VolumeRendering/Assets/3rdparty/SimpleITK folder must contain SimpleITK binaries, otherwise there will be compilation errors. Paste binaries from here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/simpleitk/files/SimpleITK/1.2.4/CSharp/. It is then possible to update these libraries thru Unity Menu->VolumeRendering->Settings->Disable/Enable SimpleITK, it asks to download it again, which should download the newest version
